Description: Remote For Device-under-test (R4D) Daemon
 Remote For Device-under-test (R4D) Daemon acts as controlling server for test
 racks. Each Rack contains a serial device server and a power control switch.
 A rack can host several DUTs (device-under-test).
 r4d connects to the serial device server and the power switch to perform
 actions on user request. A user connects to r4d through a SOAP interface.
 .
 This package contains the controlling daemon and administration tool.
